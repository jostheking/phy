    <h1>Constellation</h1>
    <br />
    <br>
    <p>Many of the star appear in groups forming patterns. The stars that appear in the form of closed groups and from recognisableshapes and patterns are called constellations. So far, 88 constellations have been recognised and named. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <li type='A'> Each constellation has been assigned a name signifying an animal, a human being or any other object that it appears
    to resemble.</li>
    <br>
    <li type="A">The constellations appear to move in the sky from the east to the west because the Earth rotates on its own axis
    from the west to the east.</li>
    <br>
    <li type="A"> These constellations can easily be recognised in the night sky. A constellation does not have a small number of
    stars. It consists of a group of stars. Some of the stars are bright and can be seen by the naked eye, whereas others
    are dim and are not easy to see. All the stars in a constellation are not at the same distance from the Earth. They are
    just in the same line of sight in the sky.

<h1>1.Ursa Major (Great Bear Constellation)</h1>
<br>
<br>
<li type="A">It is one the most famous constellation that can be seen clearly in summer season in the northern part of the sky at night</li>
<br>
<li type="A">It is also known as the 'Big Dipper, because of the seven prominent stars in this constellation that form the shape of a
dipper (a long-handled spoon used for drawing out water). There are three stars in the handle of the ladle (long- handle
and spoon) and four in its bowl.</li>
<br>
<li type="A">Ursa Major is also called Great Bear because the seven bright stars of Ursa Major along with several other fainter stars
form a pattern resembling a bear.</li>
<br>
<li type="A">ts Indian name is Saptarshi.</li>
<br>
<li type="A">You can locate the Pole Star with the help of Ursa Major. On a clear moonless night during early summer, you can
identify Ursa Major in the northern part of the sky. Look at the two brightest stars at the end of Ursa Major. Imagine a
straight line passing through these stars. Extend this imaginary line towards the north
direction (about five times the distance between the two stars). This line will lead to a star that is not toobright. This is the Pole Star. Observe the Pole Star for some time. You find that the Pole Star does not move at all as
other stars drift (move) from the east to the west (in a direction opposite to the rotation of the Earth). This is due
to the fact that the Pole Star lies directly above the north pole on the axis of rotation of the Earth. The position of
the Pole star does not change with time when the Earth spins around its axis. The Pole Star is very useful in finding
directions at night by sailors as it always points in the geographic north direction. It should be noted that the Pole
Star is not visible in the southern hemisphere. So, it can't help in finding directions in the southern hemisphere.</li>

    <h1>2.Ursa Minor (Little Bear Constellation)</h1>
    <br>

    <br>
    <li type="A">The Star Sirius, that is the brightest star in the sky, is located close to Orion. To locate Sirius, imagine a straight
    line passing through the three middle stars of Orion. Look along this imaginary line towards the east direction in the
    sky. This will lead to a very bright star called Sirius</li>
